id,content,rating4969,It's slow but its horrors is tense and nerve-racking at times. It Follows may have an eerily-horrifying concept but its dull dialogue and plain narrative defeats the clever scare-tactics the film offers and makes for a less-than-memorable frightening flick,34970,"An ""Excellent"" objective view of the case without being influenced by the rhetoric of mainstream press. Just like his previous Doc downloaded very informative and humanizing of people in the film",54971,Excellent movie about a boy who finds an alien and tries to help him get home. I cry every time I watch this movie. My favourite scene is the iconic bicycle ride by moonlight. Amazing!,54972,"After seeing 'Frozen', 'The Lego Movie' and 'How to Train Your Dragon 2', my admiration for this movie has diminished severely. But hey, it was fun while it lasted.",44974,"Though nowhere near the power of Up and The Incredibles, Monsters University is still enjoyable, lively, charming, and chalk-full of typical, well-timed Pixar humor. Some of the characters are not as engaging nor as memorable as those in other Pixar efforts, and the plot is derivative of other college movies. But besides these flaws, it's worth seeing for any Pixar fans.",34975,"While Robin's acting was good, his motivation and actions didn't always make sense. He was clearly a closeted character who didn't know what to do. But the writers didn't quite get the character right at all. But it was nice to see Robin once again in a drama.",24976,"Robin Williams' performance in Boulevard is fantastic. The plot is a bit formulaic and cliche at times, but I felt like it was different enough to stand on its own. It also features noteworthy performances from Kathy Baker and Roberto Aquire.",44977,"Every frame of this dystopian thriller wants to remind you how excellent Niccol's Gattaca was. He is simply trying to tell a similar story set in a different futuristic world. As far as the premise and the first couple of acts go, that really works. Once you accept the idea of people paying with time, the plot is quite fascinating at first. Sadly, it feels like they didn't know where to go with it and what to do with the minor characters. The interesting cop is entirely wasted, for example. That's still entertaining enough but by the end you feel like this could have been so much more.",34978,"Odd and enjoyable sci-fi thriller, even if somewhat predictable.",44980,"In Time is a wonderful premise done in by an aimless and weighed down script. The story goes into out-of-the-blue directions that do the premise a major disservice. Perhaps if they had fully focused the story around the Robin Hood angle more completely, In Time could have worked, but it wastes too much time with subplots involving uninteresting criminals, predictable villains and connect them together with ponderous dialogue. A wooden Timberlake and a pallid Seyfried are serviceable as leads but just like the rest of the cast the actors can't find their character's consistent core purpose so they just play them as generically as possible. Vincent Kartheiser and Cillian Murphy play versions of other characters they've played before. Shoulda coulda In Time rarely delivers on its promise.",24981,"Zipper is another cautionary tale of a flawed and whitewashed politician. In the face of many dramatized political scandals in cinemas and TVs, it is simply zippered to oblivion.",24982,"If there is an entertaining tale about a mermaid, Ron Clements and John Musker get it right in The Little Mermaid.The plot details come and go at a solid pace. While sounding like a brief run time, 80 minutes turns out to be the perfect solution to this story that is fitting for adults and children alike.The bright colors give the picture life and the musical numbers create a memorable soundtrack. It's safe to say that the visuals and music compliment the story without fail.Sure, the lead character is a mermaid with an excellent voice, thanks to Jodi Benson, but it's the supporting cast of characters that get the job done. Sam E. Wright as Sebastian. That says it all.Not much else to say except The Little Mermaid swims to the surface and explodes out of the water as a fantastic watch.",44983,"I would prefer plugging this high speed action film to those interested in cars, but due to the recent loss of my friend Paul Walker, it has become quite sad to me. His role in this series of films(Brian O'Connor) is what he's known most for, but I do wish he had landed the role of Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars pre-quels that he wanted more than anything. One thing I know for sure is that he is a Skywalker and undoubtedly one of God's best angels. His charitable work is a big part of who he was, and he was not afraid to help those in need even if it meant he was doing much of the physical labor himself. There is a great silence in the Force indeed.",34984,"This adrenaline flick classifies as one of my favourite films of all time, only because of how great it is put together! It is action packed, never get's boring, has an ensemble cast, the women are gorgeous, the acting is good enough to love the characters and care about what happens to them, and the races are wondrous. The Fast and the Furious is a pure adrenaline flick about a cop (Brian O'Connor), who goes undercover, becoming best friends with a wanted fugitive and his pals who illegally race the streets for money and party every night. I have never seen a better racing movie than this. The Fast and the Furious is just plain amazing on a technical level and is easily one of my favourites ensemble films!",54985,"Rob Cohen does a phenomenal job of bringing the world of street-racing to the big screen. An in-your-face, in-the-action direction plays well visually as well as the chemistry and performances from the main stars. The peril and interesting plot adds fuel to this machine to haul it to the finish line.",54986,Good original story about a fish who gets caught and needs to be rescued.,44987,A great all around movie. Great performance by Ellen among others and kudos to the writers.,44988,"Imagine if Big Fish was absolutely no fun. Gets points for some minor emotional impact towards the end, but even that\u0027s pulled away. Dropped plot points abound, character interactions are completely unbelievable and some heartstring-tugs are too overt to work. Some surprisingly good acting moments come from child-star Jakob Salvati though.",24989,"Critics all think they know what we should think and feel about a movie. Yet they can't face the fact that while they only gave this movie less than 5 out of 10, we REAL PEOPLE Viewers are giving it 81% and they get paid to be Wrong??? Watch it with an open mind of a little boy or girl and you'll love it!!!",54990,Heart-moving movie about a little kid who used to get bully because of his size. His father was sent to fight during WWII and the kid wishes to bring his father back by completing a list given by the town preacher that need to be fulfilled.,44991,"Not high literature, not destined for the Academy Awards. However, if you are looking for good entertainment not generated by software or criminals this may be the movie for you and your family. Worth watching!",44992,"Kinda cute or whatever. I never liked Hilary Duff in her prime (mostly due to some inexplicable aversion to her face), but she actually seemed to be a pretty grounded teen actress. Nice to see Cougar Town's moon-faced Dan Byrd as the sacrificial guy best friend.",24993,"Nice, light drama for teenagers (especially girls).",34994,"its okay, but its not at all my kind of movie!",24995,An updated Cinderella. OK for a fairytale.,34996,Just another typical Hollywood movie!,34997,The worst movie I've seen this year. It's overflowing with boring people and even more boring improvsied dialogue. The only reason I gave it one star is because it was filmed using 35mm and looks great.,14998,"I love this movie. In one shot, Rosemarie DeWitt can convey in an instant regret, anger, excitement, arousal and disappointment. She and Jake Johnson make for a believable, ordinary couple in an extraordinarily affluent world. I admire Swanbergs choices to empower his actors with helping him tell the story with improvisation, but also his stylistic choices. His best film yet.",54999,"A documentary that looks at the legacy of the US's War On Drugs. It's undeniably fascinating subject matter but its filmed in a rather sedate, distancing manner, I wanted something more passionate and angry, more exhaustive.",35000,"Pretty good documentary about the evils of cops, politicians, prosecutors and judges serving the almighty dollar, if not just their completely racist fantasies. All because the ignorant American population lets them.",45001,As a film its a bit incoherent and veers a little towards left wing conspiracy but it certainly address important issues.,35002,"Although not as memorable or controlling as the first, Pitch Perfect 2 is still vivacious, crude and entertaining. The film builds up from its sensational start and provides even more impactful numbers and catchy tunes to make for a pretty good sequel.",45003,A completely washed out script that is saved by some good singing.,25004,"No where near as charming or addictive as the first, Pitch Perfect 2 has a bit of an identity crises and the writing is just not good enough, bit winning performances from Kendrik and Wilson and zippy direction from Banks have me hopeful for a return to film with a possible threequel.",35005,"I love the music and I love the characters, but this installment is nowhere near as funny as the first one was, and there was way less of the music that made the first film so great. With more music and less stupid one-liners, I would have enjoyed this one much more.",35006,"Simple, but solid indie with suspense and beautiful cinematography.",45007,One of the best films of the year. A masterpiece.,55008,"Kind of meh, but reminded me of old exploitation movies from the 70s. Kevin Bacon is pretty good and the movie flies by, but it's a bit silly. A quick, painless watch that could be worse.",35009,"Intriguingly cruel, but disappointingly lazy for much of the second half. Nicely shot though!",35010,The first movie I have seen in a long time that I walked away from feeling like I really understood the actions and conversations taken place by the children.,45011,"A gripping, tastefully-told story. Little more, little less.",35012,Meh. Good performances ruined by a stupid plot.,25013,Very simple premise but solid indie film. Darker than expected.,35014,"This movie is bad, yes, but it's an interesting type of bad movie. A lot of really cool sets and other odd visual decisions make this a rather intriguing failure. The main problem is just how boring the whole thing is, and i mean tediously boring, dull, lifeless. Uma Thurman is probably the most boring actress i have ever seen in my life. From this to Kill BIll her range hasn't improved one bit.",35015,"One of my childhood movies, boring for most but a guilty pleasure of mine.",35016,I tried sooooooooo hard to like this movie. I really really did.,15017,"A cliche romance that does not live up to it's massive hype. The connection between the two narratives is easily figured out in advanced, and the relationship between the two characters is hard to believe. It's a film for a certain type of audience, and director Nick Cassavetes makes all attempts to wring every tear from that audience.",35018,"Every girl's favorite movie! It's pretty touching, coming from a dude.",45019,"To say this movie is horrible and unenjoyable is completely unfair. It is in fact highly enjoyable and touching. However, there is a bit too much sap for me.",35020,"Suspenseful, intense, heartwrenching, nail-biting, and just quite simply amazing. The performances and direction were brilliant. The script and dialogue could've been better but I loved what came out of this film.",4
